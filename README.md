# Personal-Project-2023
This is my personal project that I did for programming 12. I decided to make a webapp that would take uploaded audio and play it. 

### Background Info:
I decided to make a web app that would allow the user to play audio. Audio files would be uploaded to the webapp which would take them and insert them into a database. From there the user could select the audio file they want to load, then play it in the player. This project involved various methods, languages, and lots of trial and error to complete, but the final product came out sufficient and satisfying.

### Resources:
* Visual Code Studio
* Python programming language
* SQL programming language
* Websites/tutoriels online
* Visual Code Studio extensions
<br>

### The Idea:
The idea for this project came by chance. I wanted to make something that would be a challenge for me but also managable. Naturally, creating a webapp to preform a common and useful task like playing audio could do this. While brainstorming I also realized that this project would allow me to use new software like ***Streamlit*** to make the webapp, ***SQL*** to set up the database, and various ***VS Code extensions*** to fill in the gaps. Thus, I began programming after my planning was complete.

### I was curious about this project because...
I wanted to see how much I could ***improve my coding abilities*** by using new languages and those I already knew. Likewise, I use many digital audio players for music in my free time and I wanted to experience the process of coding such a system and how difficult it is. ***Using a database*** to store audio was something I was intrigued by too and wanted to explore.

### So far I have learned and completed...
The first step to creating this web app was to establish the basic page and a plan for its layout. I made a rough draft of how I wanted it to be set up as can be seen here.
